# TheSandbox

I'm Earl Hapal and I present to you, The Sandbox.

My website is about web development workshop for kids and teens - just like Tuitt, but for kids and teens. The website aims to primarily attract parents, students, and other tech and cute-loving folks to enroll to such workshops. 

So to attract, I placed a minigame (available to large screens only) as an alternative to the jumbotron. Basic colorful layout utilizing panels and maximizing the use of bootstrap color schemes - primary, success, info, warning, and danger. The design was inspired by my kids and the kid in me.

This page is viewable in desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. For anyone who is interested to have their websites crafted by me, e-mail or call me. ;)

Issues encountered: Footer issues - absolute bottom 0 is not working. And it seems that the resolution of devices set in bootstrap 3 is outdated - I tested my website on a tablet (considered medium device), landscape mode and somehow, specific element for large devices still appear.
Areas of Improvement: Graphics
How to improve as a coder: Code faster, find a way to effeciently refactor codes.
